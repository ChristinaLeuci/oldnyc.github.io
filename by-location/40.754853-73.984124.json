The idea of an industrial exposition housed in a building\nof glass and iron originated in London with the Crystal Palace of\n1851, in Hyde Park. The New York building, however, was smaller\nthan its London predecessor, and entirely different in appearance.\nIt was originally planned to build the Crystal Palace in\nMadison Square Park, but the protests of residents in that fashionable\nneighborhood compelled the abandonment of the scheme. The land in\nback of the Croton Reservoir, now Bryant Park, but then known as\nReservoir Square, was leased from the City for a nominal rental of\none dollar a year. Construction work began in 1852, and the building.\nhousing the first World's Fair to be held in the United States, was\nformally opened on July 14, 1853, by President Franklin Pierce.\nThe building, however, was not a financial success, as its London\npredecessor had been. The city took possession in May of 1858, and\non October 5 of that year, while the City Fathers were debating the\nquestion of the removal of the building, and while the annual ex-\nposition of the American Institute was in progress, fire broke out,\nand the building was completely destroyed. The land was then con-\nverted by the city into the present Bryant Park.\nThis is a photograph made for the sake of preservation from\nthe original, a rare and badly faded photograph, whose plate has\n1ong ago been lost.
