The bank is about to move into the ground floor. In\nthe background may be seen the tower of the nen Consolidated Gas and\nNew Yorl Edison Building, recently completed on 14th Street on the\nsite of the old Tammony Hall and the Academy of Musio.\nThe Society of St. Tammany, or Colunbian Ordor, was founded in\nPhiladelphia and spread through Hew England, before a New York City\nchapter was established in 1789. It was originally a benevolent\norganization, and first identified itself with politics in the\npresidential campaign of 1800, when, under the leadership of Vice-\nPresential candidate Aaron Burr, it supported the Jefferson-Surr\nticket. The first Tammany Hall, built in 1801, stood on Frankfort\nand Nassau Streets. On July 4, 1868, the second Hall on 14th Street\nwas opened with the Democratic National Convention of that year. In\n1928 it moved into the present building.\nThe Tammany Hall General Committee, with which it is practically\nidentical in membership, has for a long time bcen in control of the\nDemocrctic Party in New York County, at times almost to the point of\ncomplete identification with it. This picture, for instance, is taken\nnear the height of Mayor James J. .alker's popularity, the spring\npreceding his re-election. Tammany Hall is not only identified with\nthe Party in Manhattan, but is working harmoniously with the leaders\nof the other four boroughs.\nMay, 1929.\n",
