According to Mr. Armbruster, the mansion,\nsituated on a large estate, was owned by F.N. Lawrence in 1860 and\nby W.H. Sanger in 1873. Beers's 1873 map also shows it as the\nSanger property, just below the Boyce farm on Cakland Lake (Douglas\nPond).\nThe estate, known as ''The Oaks,'' was opened by a member of\nthe Hicks family and afterwards owned by Lawrence and later by John\nHenderson and John Taylor. In 1891 it was owned by John Taylor\n(Wolverton's map) and then comprised 263.25 acres. It was the F.N.\nTaylor property in 1909. The distant views were most likely taken\nfrom Horace Harding Boulevard, formerly West Alley, which marked\nthe southern limit of the estate. The Horatio Parkway location\nmarks the site of the mansion proper, were it standing when the new\nthoroughfares were laid out.\nEugene L.
