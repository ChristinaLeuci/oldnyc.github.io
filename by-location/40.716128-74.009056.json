The writer believes that the photographer is standing on the \"El\" platform station at Chambers Street. The wooded area in the left center is the small Duane Park. Beyond appears the American Express Building at the S. W. corner of Jay Street. The opposite corner (with canopy) will become the site of the House of Relief of the New York Hospital and which later housed the present Marine Hospital.\nAbout 187Oa\nH. N.
