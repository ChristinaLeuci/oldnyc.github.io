This house was built early in the eightecuth century, and at the time of this photograph is not quite two hundred years old. The two wings are not a part of the original house, but were added during the 1860's. The house is falling into disrepair through long neglect, but it will soon be restored and converted into a museum, with the surrounding land a city park. The north wing will be demolished, but the south wing will stand as late as 1936, at which\ntime it will be in use as a caretaker's residence.\n1895.\nGift of John H. Judd.\n",
