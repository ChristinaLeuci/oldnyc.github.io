It is particularly interesting as showing graphically how the metropolis is being honeycomoed for its underground transportation system. In order not to interfere with the ordinary use of the streets during the three 7ears necessary bo complete the work, the tunneling method is used rather than open excavaton work. Yor a 1ong psr  1 after the earth has een Ng U0 and before the steel S concrete uork is coa)leted, the sucf:ce of the street is merely boards propped up by :oden beas. An extra-heavy blast, with )erhaps other contributing factors, causeo ths suports bh collapse, and the whole street - Vith its occupants, including s croEded street car - dro)ped to the bottom.
