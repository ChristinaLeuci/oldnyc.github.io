It is particularly interesting as showing graphically how\nthe metropolis is being honeycomoed for its underground transportation\nsystem. In order not to interfere with the ordinary use of the\nstreets during the three 7ears necessary bo complete the work, the\ntunneling method is used rather than open excavaton work. Yor a 1ong psr  1\nafter the earth has een Ng U0 and before the steel S concrete uork\nis coa)leted, the sucf:ce of the street is merely boards propped up\nby :oden beas.
