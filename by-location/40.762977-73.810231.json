Eugene L.\nArmbruster, the Collector, states that this house was moved from its\nold site in 1923 because it was in the line of 155th Street. However,\nthe writer believes the house was moved because of the widening of\nNorthern Boulevard. See Queens Atlas of 1909. Originally this house\nfaced north on Broadway; it now faces west on 155th Street.\n1924.\nEucene L. Armbruster Collection.\nMAY BE REPRODUCED.\n",
