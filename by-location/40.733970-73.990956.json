This structure was erected as Wallacks\nTheatre and opened on September PD, 1861. It was here that\nthe name Wallack gained its brightest laurels.

Stoddard, Henry Montgue, Dion Boucicault,\nCharles Coghlan, Fanny Morant, Rose Eytinge, Katherine Rogers\nand Rose Coghlan appeared here. The plays presented were the\nstandard old comedies and the best of the works of contempor-\naneous Lnglish dramatists. The house and company were famous\nfor the general excellence of the productions, rather than for\nthe brilliancy of particular events. It became the Germania\nin 1881, and the rechristened Star in 1883. Theodore Moss was\nthe manager for many years and remodelled the interior in 1883\nand in 1889.
