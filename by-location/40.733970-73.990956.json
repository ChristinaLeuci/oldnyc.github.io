    "text": "B4 Broadway, at the N. E. corner of East 13th Street, showing the Star Theatre. This structure was erected as Wallacks Theatre and opened on September PD, 1861. It was here that the name Wallack gained its brightest laurels. Charles Fisher, John Sefton, Mark Smith, John Gilbert, James Williamson, E. L. Davenport, J. H. Stoddard, Henry Montgue, Dion Boucicault, Charles Coghlan, Fanny Morant, Rose Eytinge, Katherine Rogers and Rose Coghlan appeared here. The plays presented were the standard old comedies and the best of the works of contemporaneous Lnglish dramatists. The house and company were famous for the general excellence of the productions, rather than for the brilliancy of particular events. It became the Germania in 1881, and the rechristened Star in 1883. Theodore Moss was the manager for many years and remodelled the interior in 1883 and in 1889. Note the sign in the store window announcing the proposed demolition. On the right is an eastward view on the north side of East 13th Street, across Fourth Avenue. Huber's\n14th Street Palace and Euseum aopears there.\nVN2\n",
