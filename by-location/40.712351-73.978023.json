Irrespective of same, it still has\na simdlar appearance in 1938, although several of the buildings on\nthe right have been demolished as part of a slum clearance project\nunder the joint auspices of the City and the Works Progress Adminis-\ntration. Included in same was the demolition of No. 29 112 which is\nhreputed to be possible the oldest structure in Manhattan, containing\nfrom the writers personal observation old Dutch brick, same being\nhalf the present size and composed of yellow clay.\nNote the narrow walks and the cobblestoned street bed, the latter\nsloping downhill with horse drawn vehicles there upon. forming the\ncontour which has given this area it's name. Several gas lamps appear\nin conjunction with numerous saloons and former residences converted\ninto tenements.\nUrchins in the foreground are the progeny of the inhabitants of the\nsqualid buildings lining this street. These differ radically from the\nformer residents whoin their day formed the select of the City; No. 1\nbeing the first Presidential residence. A tablet to this effect is now\nattached to the base of the Brooklyn Bridge at this point. \"aoss' Tweed\nis humorously reported by Dennis Lynch, in his book bearing that title,\nto have offered to donate the funds to erect a church there, stating it\nto have been his birth place. True or false, it is a fact that he was\nborn on this street,as was his father.\n",
