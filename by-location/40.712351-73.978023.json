    "text": "Cherry Street, east from (No. 24, left margin), a point between Frenklin Scquare and Roosevelt Street, and to the latter, showing a slum area, long known as Cherry Hill and in which numerous sociological studies have been conducted. Irrespective of same, it still has a simdlar appearance in 1938, although several of the buildings on the right have been demolished as part of a slum clearance project under the joint auspices of the City and the Works Progress Administration. Included in same was the demolition of No. 29 112 which is hreputed to be possible the oldest structure in Manhattan, containing from the writers personal observation old Dutch brick, same being\nhalf the present size and composed of yellow clay.\nNote the narrow walks and the cobblestoned street bed, the latter sloping downhill with horse drawn vehicles there upon. forming the contour which has given this area it's name. Several gas lamps appear in conjunction with numerous saloons and former residences converted\ninto tenements.\nUrchins in the foreground are the progeny of the inhabitants of the squalid buildings lining this street. These differ radically from the former residents whoin their day formed the select of the City; No. 1 being the first Presidential residence. A tablet to this effect is now attached to the base of the Brooklyn Bridge at this point. \"aoss' Tweed is humorously reported by Dennis Lynch, in his book bearing that title, to have offered to donate the funds to erect a church there, stating it to have been his birth place. True or false, it is a fact that he was\nborn on this street,as was his father.\n",
