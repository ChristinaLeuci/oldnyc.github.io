This club, founded in 1879, held its first\nraces on the Prospect Park Fair Grounds. I 1880 the construction of the\nSheepshead Bay Race Track was completed, and it was opened on June 19, 1880.\nWilliam K. Vanderbilt was president in 1904. TNis track was one mile in\ncircumference, but it was extended in 1884 to 1 and 18 miles, and in 1886,\na mile track was constructed inside the old. The oval track was between\nEast 23rd Street and Nostrand Ave., and Aves. W and 2.  Mrs Harriman a\ndaughter of one Gerritsen owned this track which comprised about 125 acres,\nthat was purchased by Max Natanson, Joseph P, Day, and Charles F. Noyes for\n.S2,400,O00 on April 1, 1915. They in turn, cut it into lots and sold them\nat auction in August and September 1923. Parts of the track in (1937) in-\ncluding some of the stables may yet be seen. The grounds are still referred\nto as the Harkness Estate. This view shows the stands and straight-away.\nThe foundations of the stands are still visible north of Jerome Ave. (1937)\n",
