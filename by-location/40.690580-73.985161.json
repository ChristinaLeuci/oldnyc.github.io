Re can\nappreciate his embarrassment, and sympathize with his appre-\nhensions in the performance of so many and such conflicting\nduties as are specially named; b t when the monstrous addition\nis affixed 'and such other occasional services as the very\nw0NINREE09fN9 and ponderous schout and the dignified and exaoting\nschepens should enact for his worriment,' human emotion is\ntoo feeble to be commensurate with the demmand.''\nYet insignificant ss was the beginning the light has never\nheen cuenched.
