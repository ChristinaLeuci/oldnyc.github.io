To the right center are buildings at the S.W.\ncorner of this intersection.\nKings ''Handbook of New York'' states that the inventor\nCharles C. Harvey was permitted to build an experimental\ntrack along Greenwich Street from the Battery to 29th St.\nIf it succeeded he was to have permission to exxtend the\nline to the Harlem River, but if it failed he was to take\nit down. The system was commenced in 1867 and the means\nof locomotion was a wire rope drawn by a stationary engine.\nThe method was unsuccessful and the matter lay in sbayence\nfor several years. The company failed in 1870 and was suc-\nceeded by the New York Elevated Railroad Co. which began\nthe use of small locomotives on the tracks.\n",
