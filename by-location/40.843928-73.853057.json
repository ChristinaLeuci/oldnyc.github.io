According to Bromley's map of 1900, an old Morris Park station was situated at what is now (1937) a plot adjoining the S.T:. corner of Bronxdale and Van Nest Aves., near the railroad's present workshops. It was a frame depot at the very gate of the famous Morris Park Race Track. It was dismantled between 1900 and 1913 (Bromley mape) during which period many streets were laid out on the former track grounds and surrounding properties. The station here shown, was opened to passenger traffic in 1913 even though it had been completed for some\ntime prior to that date.\n",
