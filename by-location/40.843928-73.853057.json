According to Bromley's map of 1900, an old Morris\nPark station was situated at what is now (1937) a plot adjoining the\nS.T:. corner of Bronxdale and Van Nest Aves., near the railroad's present\nworkshops. It was a frame depot at the very gate of the famous Morris\nPark Race Track. It was dismantled between 1900 and 1913 (Bromley mape)\nduring which period many streets were laid out on the former track\ngrounds and surrounding properties. The station here shown, was opened\nto passenger traffic in 1913 even though it had been completed for some\ntime prior to that date.\n",
