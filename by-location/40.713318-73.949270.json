Armbruster states that the factory was located on Ainslie Street near Yenth Street, the present (1941) Keap Street, the writer of these lines was unable to locate any saw factory at that location from 1874 to the present. The only saw factory, or file factory (the two are used interchangeably in the old Brooklyn buslness directories), in this area appears in Hromleys 1880 map on the south side of Devoe Street (which is oue block Iorth of Ainslie Street), Just west of Lorimer -treet. It is very likely that this is the saw factory Mr. Armbruster has in mind.\nEugene L. Armbruster Collection  about 1890\n",
