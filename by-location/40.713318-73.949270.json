The only saw factory, or file factory (the\ntwo are used interchangeably in the old Brooklyn buslness\ndirectories), in this area appears in Hromleys 1880 map on\nthe south side of Devoe Street (which is oue block Iorth of\nAinslie Street), Just west of Lorimer -treet. It is very\nlikely that this is the saw factory Mr. Armbruster has in mind.\nEugene L.
