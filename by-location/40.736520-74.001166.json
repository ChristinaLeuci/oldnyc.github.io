This hospital\nwas founded in 1849 under the patronage of Archbishop Hughes and\nin charge of his sister, Mother Angela. At that time there were\nonly two other hospitals in New York City (Manhattan and the\nBronx). The hospital moved to this site in 1856 or '57, taking\nover the building of the Catholic Half-Orphan Aaylum which stood\nat 153 West 11th Street. In 1898, after demolition of that build-\ning, half of this building was erected on the site. 'he western\nhalf, on the corner of Seventh Avenue, was added in 1905, re-\nplacing the old houses 163-5 West 11th Street and 1-5 Seventh\nAvenue. See Seventh Avenue, also 12th Street, for the other\nbuildings of the hospital.\nThe hospital is in charge of the Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent\nde Paul. Mulry iquare, where Seventh Avenue begins, at the\nintersection of 11th Street and Greenwich Avenue, was named after\nthe late Thomas M. Mulry, President of the United States Society\nof St. Vincent de Paul and President of the Emigrant Savings\nBank; he lived nearby, at 10 Ferry Street.\nMarch 12, 1933.\nP. L.
