The little house farther along on the avenue is tho modernized house standing on the old Howland farm, which adjoined the Smith farm on the north. The apartment houses beyond, on the S.E. corner of 176th Street, wene built around 1924. Around 1910, Haven Avenue used to be known as Buena Vista Avenue.\nMay 27, 1927.\nP. L.
