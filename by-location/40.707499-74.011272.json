It had snowed steadily for twenty-four\nhours on March 12, and the snow continued to fall on the\n13th, while the temperature dropped to four degrees\nbelow zero and the wind rose to a velocity of eighty-four\nmiles an hour. It was estimated that the storm took a\ntoll of 400 1ives and 920,000,000 in property dage.\nThe complex life of the city was at a complete standstill\nfor two days. Ihawing temperatures on March 14 aided in\nthe slow task of digging out, which continued for\nseveral days. There were countless freak consequences\nof the storm, such as the sending of messages from\nBoston to New York by way of London, because all land\ntelegraph service was disrupted, but the submarine\ncables were undisturbed. The average fall of snow was\nthree feet four inches, but the high winds piled the\ndrifts up to second-story window levels in msny places.\nThree scenes from the blizzard are sent you.\nR-3938 (G)\n(Special feature layout for release March 13)\nWide World Photo: Please Watch Credit\n829148 - Please See Main Caption Above\nNOV Y0Y CII PiDI EASSAGO IN TRC MIODLE\nOE TEO EAIBLIE2A0\nNew York, N.Y. - This photograph was taken after the storm\nhad subsided and shows New Street, looking toward Wall Street.\nN-3Y938 (S)\nNe.'133:\n",
