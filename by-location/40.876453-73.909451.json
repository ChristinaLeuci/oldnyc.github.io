The fort was built in 1776\nduring the Revolution and was named after Prince Charles William Ferdinand,\nbrother-in-law of King George III. It was constructed for the purpose of\ncontrolling pasaage across King's Bridge, over Spuvten Duvvil Creek, which\nin turn was built in 1693 by a royal grant given to Frederick Philipse,\nby Eing William III, after whom it was named. In 1776 when the Hessian\nArmv made decisive advances against the Colonials the fort was abandoned and\nin Nevember, the Hessians who took possession of it, named it Fort Prince of\nBrunswick, a brother-in-law of King George III of England. This area is\nrich with the glorious traditions of the Colonials, who fought in these\nenvirons many a battle under George Washington's command. A flag pole\nnow commemorates the site of the Fort.\nMarch 28, 1906.\n",
