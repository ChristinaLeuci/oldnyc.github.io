The 3-story white frame house (right) bears No. 86; next to it, but slightly separated is No. 96, a 2 -story frame house, partially obstructing from view St. Stephen's (M.E.) Church, another frame structure, at the S.E. corner of Marble Hill Ave. and West 228th Street (formerly Terrace View Ave.). The 22-story frame house, shown prominently, on the left, bears No. 91 Marble Hill Ave., at the N.W. corner of West 227th Street, and is seen facing on the latter Street. Between Marble Hill Ave. and the Creek is visible a portion of West 228th Street, and across the Creek, in a northeasterly direction, is the Borough of The Bronx, as seen from the former site of Fort Prince Charles (hill, left foreground). The fort was built in 1776 during the Revolution and was named after Prince Charles William Ferdinand, brother-in-law of King George III. It was constructed for the purpose of controlling pasaage across King's Bridge, over Spuvten Duvvil Creek, which in turn was built in 1693 by a royal grant given to Frederick Philipse, by Eing William III, after whom it was named. In 1776 when the Hessian Armv made decisive advances against the Colonials the fort was abandoned and in Nevember, the Hessians who took possession of it, named it Fort Prince of Brunswick, a brother-in-law of King George III of England. This area is rich with the glorious traditions of the Colonials, who fought in these environs many a battle under George Washington's command. A flag pole\nnow commemorates the site of the Fort.\nMarch 28, 1906.\n",
