The hotel was enlarged by annexing and remodelling on 24th and 25th Streets, and in 1885 the eight-story fireproof building, adjoining the 25th Street corner, was completed and opened. This was one of the most famous hotels of its time, and noted especially for its bar-room, on the 24th Street side, which was a veritable art gallery. In 1904 the old part of the hotel, facing on Broadway, will be demolished and rebuilt. h hotel will fin1ly close its doors in 1914, and the following year loft buildings will Ieplace the Hoffman House and the Albemarle, in this block.\n",
