On October 12th, 1860, a grand ball was given here for Edward (the future Edward VII) Prince of Wales, on the occasion of his visit to New York during his tour of North America.\n\nThe original Academy of Music, on this site, was burned May 22nd, 1866 and the building pictured here was opened the following February.  In 1887 the Academy Company decided not to compete further with the new and fashionable Metropolitan Opera House, and accordingly sold this building, after which it became a dramatic house.\n\nAs a legitimate theatre it was famous, among other things for the phenomenal run of \"The Old Homestead\" from August 30th 1888 to May 1891.  The elder Sothern and others also played for long runs.\n\nOn the afternoon of November 16th, 1919 the Prince of Wales, grandson of Edward VII, will pay the Academy a visit.  By that time it will have become a motion picture house.  Finally in 1926, it will be demolished and the gourd under the building will become part of the site of the new Consolidated Gas Building.\n\nMarch 1909",
