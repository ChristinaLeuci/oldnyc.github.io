W. corner of Franklin ttreet (right), viewing across the open area identified as Finn Square, formed at the point of convergence by West Broadway and Varick Street. Ordinarily this location would be a pottion of the latter thoroughfare, as it is apparently a continuation. The fact remains that both sides of the Square are classified as being West Broadway. A one story tax-payer (No. 137 Franklin Street) is shown upon the former site of the Fifth Ward Museum. This was operated by an individual named \"Riley\". On exhibition there, included with other incunabula was the statue of William Pitt. Tho New York Historical Society posseses same\ntoday.\nThe New York Sun published a drawing of the old Hotel building in their series \"O1d New York in Pictures\". This was No. 169, titled, 'Tho Fifth Ward Museum Hotel in 1864'. The large building bearing the various signs is No. 139\nFranklin Street, and adjoins the corner.\n",
