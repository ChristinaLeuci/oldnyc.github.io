Morris\nPark. The deepest part of the old Harlem Creek bed is between\n106th and 107th Streets. For some reason Drips' Plan of New York\nfor 1867 and for 1868 utterly fails to show the big building in the\ncenter of the picture, which should be at about 110th Street and\nFifth Avenue, nor any of the buildings just west of Fourth Avenue\naround 110th Street except the five small houses neanest the camera,\non the S.W. corner of 110th Street. The steeple on the horizon to\nthe right is probably the Mt. Morris Baptist Church at Fifth Avenue\nnear 126th Street; this is, howeven, only a guess.\nThis photograph was used as an illustration in the first of Henny\nCollins Brown's Valentine's Manuwle, 1916-17, opposite page 91.\n1860.\nNew York Edison Company Collection.\nN7c-ww S 22S\nARg R 0G9\n",
