On one side was a natural fire-place, where tle Indians used to enioy their corn feasts and oyster banquets. Under its cool shade, the Huguenots rested on their lon Sabbath Day journeys from New Rochelle down to the old French Protestant Church in lower New York. After serving as a natural landmark to early settlers and to travelers in stage coaches enroute from New York to Boston, it has finally been blasted into countless fragments so as no longer to \"obstruct the march\nof civilization.\"\n",
