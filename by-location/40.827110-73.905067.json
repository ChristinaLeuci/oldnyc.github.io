On one side was a natural fire-place, where tle Indians\nused to enioy their corn feasts and oyster banquets. Under its cool\nshade, the Huguenots rested on their lon Sabbath Day journeys from New\nRochelle down to the old French Protestant Church in lower New York.\nAfter serving as a natural landmark to early settlers and to travelers\nin stage coaches enroute from New York to Boston, it has finally been\nblasted into countless fragments so as no longer to \"obstruct the march\nof civilization.\"\n",
