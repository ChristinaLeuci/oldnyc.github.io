This structure was built in 1835 or 1837, to replace a smaller school house built in 1786. The older building had originally been standing a little further back, and was moved to the new site given by a member of the Lott Family, who needed the old site for building purposes. The building was razed in 1926, because the site was required for the widening of Kings Highway which cuts diagonally across East 55th Street at this\npoint.\nMarch 1923.\nEugene L.
