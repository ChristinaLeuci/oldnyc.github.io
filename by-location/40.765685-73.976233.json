Under construction there is the new N.Y. Athletic Club occupying the former sites of 2 of the old \"Spanish Flats,\" the Madrid and the Lisbon. The Cordova and the Granada (45 story, Essex Hose erected here prior to 1954)are still standing while to the left is a cleared space where the Valencia stood (present site of the 36 story Hampshire House). Across the latter feature appears a corner of the rear of the Salamanca which faces on W. 58th Street. In 1930 this site was completely vacant. The photographer is viewing southwestward from the \"C1iffs\" of Central Park.\nMay 25, 1928.\nP. L. Sperr\n",
