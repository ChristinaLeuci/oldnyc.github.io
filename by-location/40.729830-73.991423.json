This structure was the former Astor Place Opera House, remodelled in 1854 for the Association on their removal from Nassau and Beekman Street's. A new building will be erected here in 1891 for their purpose. The library was founded November 9, 1820, by clerks of merchants. In 1821, in one room at 49 Fulton Street, it had 150 members and 700 volumes. In 1826, in the building of Harper & Bros. in Cliff Street, it had 6000 books. In 1828 the merchants made enthusiastic by the achievements of the clerks, organized the Clinton Hall Association for the purpose of giving a building to the library. This association, in 1830, erected the first Clinton Hall on the corner of Nassau and Beekman Streets. The building herewith shown is the second Clinton Hall. On the right is East 8th Street; Broadway is at the left.\n\nPrior to 1891\n\nGift of Urbrook Collection",
