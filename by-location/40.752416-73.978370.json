When this station was built in 1871 the railroad began by leaving the engine here and having the cars pulled down to Madison Square by horse; some years before the date of this picture even that had ceased, and this station became a terminal for all trains.

Like the Mercury on the present Grand Central they're all poised for flight but never fly.\n\nAccording to a feature article appearing in the N.Y. News magazine Jan. 2, 1966 the above cast iron eagle was one of 16 which once adorned the top of the old Grand Central Station on 42nd St. N.Y.C.  Those birds were added to the remodelled station in 1898.  But only remained on their perch for 5 years. Then were removed when the station was rebuilt in 1903. The News illustrated 9 of the 16 in their present locations. The one above and another are now on Villa St. Mount Vernon, N.Y. (over for map)\n",
