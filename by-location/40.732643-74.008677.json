W. corner of Washington Street,\nshowing \"T:cAvoy's Drug Storw\" which was operated by a loc9l charscter\nlovingly known as \"Mother McAvoy.\" To sailors and truckmen of the\nneighborhood she was more than a druggist. She was a friendly coun-\nsellor, and a 'bank\" and \"post office\" for sailors on their brief\nstays ashore. From her old-fashioned desk in the store and through\nher self-acquired knowledge of various foreign languages, and acting\nas a Notary Public she helped many sailors turn to land lubbering.\nProximity to the Federal Building increased her field of operations.\nShe was born in Rome, N. Y. and was graduated from N. Y. C. P. in\n1902. After clerking in several drug-stores she bought this little\nstore for 13500. At this time her olientele consisted of many New\nJersey people who commuted on the Christopher Street Ferry. She\ndied at the age of 64.
