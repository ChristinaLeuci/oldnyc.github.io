At Waverly Place, which forks here, is the Northern Dispensary, one of Greenwich Village's older landmarks, built in 1801. It is a building bounded on two sides by one street (or at any rate, what is nowadays one street in name), and on the third side by two streets, Christopher and Grove; its northern side follows the line of Grove Street.\nThe triangular park, on the south side of Christopher Street and the north side of Grove Street, was officially named Greenwich Park in 1856; but the name is hardly ever used.\n10 Sheridan square (q.v.) the new apartment building under construction at the right is the Shenandoah apartment house, which replaces the old houses at 80 and 82 Grove Street, at and adjoining the corner of Grove Street and the western end of Washington Place (originally West 5th Street).\nEwing Oslloway.\nAbout 1928.\n",
