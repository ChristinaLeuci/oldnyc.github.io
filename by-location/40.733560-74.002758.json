Before long, however, the true 4th Street on the East Side was extended to this point, and that number was applied to this street all the way to its terminus at 13th and\nGansevoort Streets, west of Eighth Avenue.\nThe block on the east side of 4th Street, from Christopher to 10th (formerly Amos) Streets, was broken up when Seventh Avenue South was cut through around 1914.
