The first services conducted by this church were held in Classical Hall on Washington Street, August 17, 1833. The first pastor was Rev. David H. Barlow, who served until 1838. In 1835 it purchased and moved into the building formerly occupied by the Second Presbyterian Church on Adams Street, (afterwards known as Gothic Hall). The congregation incorporated and became known as the First Unitarian Church of Brooklyn, after the dedication of the present building on April 24, 1844, the present name was adopted.
